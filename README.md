# Notes

Looks like building a software-only Spotify visualizer isn't feasible due to DRM software that makes it very difficult to intercept the audio stream. Even building an Electron app doesn't getting around this (https://github.com/castlabs/electron-releases).

It also breaks Spotify's API policy (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/start-a-users-playback).
